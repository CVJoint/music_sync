# Music Sync

Here are the scripts I used to sync my Dead folder.

I found that the unzipped directory names did not match the same format as the
zipped file names (which I prefer) and that in a few rare cases there were extra
files or differences in how the folder had been zipped.

These scripts will:
1. Sync a shared gdrive folder with your local folder.
2. Extract the files with the same directory structure.
3. Identify which unzipped folders need to be checked.
4. Move the files after you've corrected any errors.

You'll have to change the directory names as needed. I kept my folder structure
as an example in some of the scripts.
